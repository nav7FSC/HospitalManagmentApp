## Project Overview
The **Hospital Management App** is designed to improve the way hospitals manage their operations by providing an intuitive and efficient application. This system aims to automate various administrative tasks, helping hospital staff focus more on patient care rather than paperwork. Built with JavaFX, this application features a modern graphical user interface (GUI) that is easy to navigate. By using Microsoft Azure as the backend, the system ensures that all data is securely stored and easily accessible to authorized users.

The project addresses several critical aspects of hospital management, including patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, and inventory control. By integrating these features into a single platform, the system reduces errors, saves time, and enhances overall workflow efficiency. Our target users are hospital administrators, healthcare professionals, and support staff who require a reliable system to manage their daily activities effectively.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: The application includes a secure login system where users register and log in with unique credentials. This feature helps protect sensitive information and ensures that only authorized personnel access the system.

- **Patient Management**: Users can add new patients, edit existing records, and maintain comprehensive medical histories, including allergies and treatments. This feature enables healthcare providers to quickly access vital patient information during visits.

- **Appointment Scheduling**: Staff can easily schedule, modify, or cancel patient appointments. The system provides a calendar view for better visibility of appointments and sends automatic reminders to both patients and staff, reducing the likelihood of missed appointments.

- **Billing and Invoicing**: The application generates invoices for patient services automatically based on the treatment provided. It tracks payments and outstanding balances, streamlining the billing process and improving revenue management for the hospital.

- **Inventory Management**: Users can manage and track medical supplies, equipment, and medications. The system notifies staff when stock levels are low, allowing for timely restocking and minimizing disruptions in patient care.

- **Report Generation**: The application provides tools to create various reports, such as daily patient visits, treatment summaries, and financial performance. These reports help hospital management analyze trends, improve services, and make data-driven decisions.

- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices. This flexibility allows hospital staff to access the system from different locations, enhancing usability and convenience.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaFX**: We choose JavaFX for creating the graphical user interface because it allows us to build a responsive and interactive application that enhances user experience.

- **MS Azure**: The backend of our application is hosted on Microsoft Azure, which offers a secure and scalable environment.
    - **Azure SQL Database**: We use this for storing all patient records, appointment information, billing details, and inventory data. It ensures data integrity and security.
    - **Azure Active Directory**: This service handles user authentication and permissions, providing a secure way to manage access to the application.
    - **Azure App Service**: This service hosts our application, making it accessible to users from anywhere with an internet connection.

- **CSS**: We use CSS to style the application, ensuring a clean, modern, and visually appealing interface that enhances user engagement.
